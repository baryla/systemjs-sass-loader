# SystemJS SASS Loader (WIP)

This is a "working" version of a SASS Loader for SystemJS. 
There are still many bugs with this so for now, I won't provide any setup/config files in case you're crazy enough to try to use this. 

This works by compiling the SASS/SCSS on the fly and injecting it in the head. 

- [ ] Support all of the crazy ways that you can import a file ie. "_components/_file/etc.scss"
- [ ] ...too many to list.
